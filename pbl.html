            <h3>Two Paths Ahead</h3>
            <p>You could keep going through these lesson pages, front to back, and then doing the assessment at the end.</p>
            <h4>OR</h4>
            <p>You can choose to go a different way. We will give you a project first, and then you can use the lesson pages as resources for your project.</p>
        	</br>

            <ul>
            	<li>Choosing the normal lesson will close this and let you continue on your way.</li>
        		<li>Choosing the different way will give you more details.</li>
